This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### interchangeable to JavaScript

## Why Next.js?

### Rendering

1. Internationalization
2. Incremental Static Generation
3. Fast Refresh

### Routing

1. Hybrid SSG(Pre-render pages at build time) & SSR(request time)
2. File-system Routing
3. API Routes

### Language Support

1. TypeScript Support
2. Sass Modules
3. Next.js Analytics

## What is the file structure?

1. public directory: directly acessibile to every one
2. pages folder: to store source codes
3. \_document.tsx: a root file with injected custom codes, SSR only
